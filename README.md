# SMSC Simulator

## About

This project is a minimal *Short Message Service Center* (SMSC) implementation that aims to facilitate the development  of *External Short Message Entities* (ESME) when there is no available SMSC's to connect with.

The simulator accepts a connection generated by a client by means of a `bind_transceiver` request, accepts SMS's to be deliver, and after a couple of seconds it simulates a response, as shown in the diagram below:

## How to use

Requirements:

1. Docker >= v18.0
2. Docker Compose >= v1.29.2

To start the server run:

```
docker-compose up
```

The container can be configured by using the following environment variables:

* PORT: the port where the server will listen to (default to 2775)
* SYSTEM_ID: the *system_id* used to authenticate incoming connections (default to "admin")
* PASSWORD: the *password* used to authenticate incoming connections (default to "secret")

## Build and run

To compile the project you can run the development Docker Compose file:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

You only need run this command once while editing the code since the project is configured with *nodemon* so any  change will trigger a re-compilation.
